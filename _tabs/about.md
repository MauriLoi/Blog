## Personal Profile

<div align="justify"> I have earned a degree in Economics and Marketing, complemented by an MSc in Data Analytics. I have been fortunate enough to have diverse work experience, managing customer service in the hospitality sector and office administration in a government institution. My academic and professional background has afforded me a broad understanding of the business world, and hands-on experience utilising supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, visualisation tools, ETL development, and predictive models. Furthermore, I possess exceptional quantitative skills and am proficient in programming languages such as R and Python.
To further my passion for Data I am currently in the final stages of a Digital Skills Bootcamp at Just IT Training to consolidate my previous acquired skills, whilst developing new modern technologies. This will be supported by my GitHub Portfolio.
I am now seeking an Entry Level role as Data Analyst or Business Analyst where I can leverage my customer-centric approach and robust analytical and technical abilities to the fullest potential. </div>
