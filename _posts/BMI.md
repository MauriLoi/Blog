The following text is about the Fourth Dutch Growth Study by Fredriks et al. (2000a, 2000b), which is a cross-sectional study that measures the growth and development of the Dutch population from birth to 21 years of age. The study collected data on height, weight, head circumference, and age for 7482 males and 7018 females. In this analysis, we are using only the BMI (Body Mass Index) of Dutch boys.  </div>   <br/>
